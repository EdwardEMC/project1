                Recreate the ‘wok hei’ at hawker stalls
                ‘Wok hei’ means the breathe of the wok, in English. It refers to the hot air produced from the heat
                in a wok that gives the extra flavour to Chinese stir-fry dishes. With char kuey teow, you need to
                stir-fry the noodles at the highest heat. Using a cast iron wok would be the best as it captures
                and maintains the high heat. You'll need to be careful to burn the noodles with the extreme heat.
                That is why you need to be fast at stirring the noodles or else they would be burnt. A slightly
                charred taste is all we need for these noodles to have the smoky flavour for which they are
                amous for.
                
                Preparing a plate of authentic char kuey teow just like those sold in Penang not only requires the
                right ingredients but also the correct techniques. I found that it is better to prepare it in small
                amount (that is one plate at a time) unless you have a big wok to work with or you are a true
                professional. I learned that the noodles turned soggy when too much sauce is added all at once.
